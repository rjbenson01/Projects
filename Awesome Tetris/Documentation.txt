AwesomeTetris is just a simple Tetris game written in Python.

AwesomeTetrisMain.py is the file that contains the "main()" of the project.
AwesomeTetrisMethods.py is the file that contains the "core" of the project, and contains all the major methods.
AwesomeTetrisTemplates.py is the file that contains all of the shape "templates" stored in a dynamicArray using key-Value pairs.
AwesomeTetrisVariables.py contains the most commonly used global variables.
(Note: Due to my inexperience with Python I had trouble getting curScore to be used correctly so I had to use it specifically as a "global" in some places)


All of the images included are ones I found online for free, and then recropped them to serve the game's purposes. 
You may reuse any of them :). The original images that they are based on are not my work, but again were free to download and use/edit.



Things I would have liked to add had I more time to complete the project:
-A timer to show overall time spent on a current game.
-Best Score being kept between games, and program exits/starts.
-Music
-Simple Animations to break up the "static" nature of the game.
-Changing backgrounds as level increases.


Attention: Please note that AwesomeTetris requires Python 3.3, and Pygame for Python 3.3 to run!
